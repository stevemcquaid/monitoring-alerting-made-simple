# Title
Monitoring & Alerting Made Simple

# Description
With systems becoming more distributed and workloads increasing at an unprecedented rate, the importance of solid monitoring primitives has never been greater. In this talk we will explore simple, robust monitoring concepts battle tested at scale. We will also explore the evolution of monitoring tooling as well as propose example migration plans for legacy systems to use modern monitoring tools and frameworks.

# Target Audience
This talk is geared towards junior to senior level developers. While highly technical material will be covered, topics will be explained in plain terms.
